WebSocket Connector supports the following triggers for inbound (server) and outbound (client) WebSockets:

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|WebSocket Type | Supported Triggers
|Inbound (server) a|

* <<inbound-listener-trigger,Inbound Listener>>
* <<on-inbound-connection-trigger,On Inbound Connection>>
* <<on-websocket-close-trigger, On Socket Close>>
|Outbound (client) a|

* <<on-websocket-close-trigger,On Socket Close>>
* <<outbound-listener-trigger, Outbound Listener>>
|===

== Inbound Listener [[inbound-listener-trigger]]

Use the `<websocket:inbound-listener>` element to expose an inbound WebSocket endpoint on a server. By hitting this endpoint, external clients can establish an inbound WebSocket. Once the WebSocket is established, clients trigger the associated app flow each time they send a message through the WebSocket.

You can use the `defaultGroups` parameter to specify the default groups to which the inbound WebSocket subscribes. When you specify default groups, the WebSocket automatically receives and processes <<websocket/websocket-connector-operations.adoc#broadcast-operation,Broadcast operations>> that are performed on these groups.

For more information about WebSocket groups, see <<websocket/websocket-connector-management.adoc#manage-groups,Manage WebSocket Groups>>.

=== Sending Responses

Because a WebSocket is full-duplex, the Inbound Listener doesn't automatically send a response. Depending on your use case, you might want to process the messages without sending a response or only send a response in certain cases.

To send a response, use the <<websocket/websocket-connector-operations.adoc#send-operation,Send operation>>.

=== Example

In the following example:

* The app flow named `sendFriendlyMessageFlow` creates an outbound WebSocket and sends the message `Hi! How are you?`to the inbound endpoint.
* The app flow named `onIncomingMessageFlow` contains an Inbound Listener that listens for messages on path `/chat/hello`. Each time it receives a message, the flow sends the response `I'm fine, thank you!`.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<
<flow name="sendFriendlyMessageFlow">
    <websocket:open-outbound-socket path="/chat" config-ref="ws" />
    <websocket:send doc:name="SendMessage" socketId="#[attributes.socketId]" config-ref="ws" >
        <websocket:content>#['Hi! How are you?']</websocket:content>
    </websocket:send>
</flow>
flow name="onIncomingMessageFlow">
    <websocket:inbound-listener ​path​=​"/chat"​ ​defaultGroups​=​"#[['AVENGERS', 'REVENGERS']]"​ ​config-ref​=​"ws"​ />
    <logger level="INFO" message="#['Received message ' ++ payload ++ ' from socket: ' ++ attributes.socketId]" />
    <websocket:send doc:name="SendResponse" socketId="#[attributes.socketId]" config-ref="ws" >
        <websocket:content>#['I'm fine, thank you!']</websocket:content>
    </websocket:send>
</flow>
----

=== Output

The Inbound Listener returns:

* A message payload that contains the inbound message content.
* An object of type `InboundWebSocketAttributes` that contains message attributes.

The message MIME type is obtained from the Content-Type header of the HTTP request. If the Content-Type header isn't set, the MIME type defaults to one of these values, depending on the protocol’s DATA frame type:

* For a binary DATA frame, the MIME type is application/octect-stream.
* For a text DATA frame, the MIME type is text/plain.

== On Inbound Connection Trigger [[on-inbound-connection-trigger]]

Use the `<websocket:on-inbound-connection>` element to invoke an app flow each time an inbound WebSocket connection is established. You can use this flow to perform post-connect tasks such as logging or subscribing the WebSocket to a group.

The `<websocket:on-inbound-connection>` element also:

* Keeps track of the generated WebSocket IDs so that the app can use them later.
* Establishes a validation point at which a WebSocket can be rejected before the app can use it.

You can only have one On Inbound Connection trigger for a given path. To use this trigger, you must also configure a matching <<inbound-listener-trigger,Inbound Listener>> for the path.

=== Sending Responses

The app flow associated with the On Inbound Connection trigger is invoked after the WebSocket is established. Therefore the WebSocket might already be broadcasting or receiving messages. The messages are queued and not delivered to the flow until the event triggered by the On Inbound Connection trigger completes. If the event fails, all queued messages are discarded and the connection drops.

=== Example

The following app flow validates attributes from the originating request and closes the connection if the validation doesn't pass:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="onNewInboundConnection">
    <websocket:on-inbound-connection doc:name="On Inbound Connection" config-ref="WebSockets_Config" path="/chat"/>
    <choice doc:name="Choice" >
        <when expression="#[contains(attributes.headers.alias, 'admin')]">
            <websocket:close socketId="#[attributes.socketId]" reason="Cannot impersonate the admin" config-ref="WebSockets_Config"/>
        </when>
        <otherwise >
            <logger level="INFO" doc:name="Logger" message="Successfully connected to WebSocket #[attributes.socketId]" />
        </otherwise>
    </choice>
</flow>
<flow name="chat">
    <websocket:inbound-listener doc:name="Inbound listener" path="/chat" config-ref="WebSockets_Config"/>
    <logger level="INFO" doc:name="Logger" message="#['Received message' ++ payload]"/>
</flow>
----

=== Output

The On Inbound Connection trigger consists of:

* An empty message payload.
* An object of type `InboundWebSocketAttributes` that contains message attributes.

== On Socket Close Trigger [[on-websocket-close-trigger]]

Use the `<websocket:on-socket-close` trigger to perform cleanup tasks when a WebSocket closes, such as logging and updating the app state.

The flow associated with the Socket Close trigger is invoked after the WebSocket closes. Therefore, the triggered flow cannot send messages through the WebSocket.

=== Example

The following example closes the WebSocket connection identified by the `ws` socket ID:

*Reviewers: Can we show a bigger example here, such as one that also logs a message when the socket is closed*

----
<websocket:on-connection-closed path="/ws/*" config-ref="ws" />
----

=== Output

The On Socket close trigger returns:

* An empty message payload.
* An object of type `CloseSocketEvent` that contains the message attributes.

== Outbound Listener [[outbound-listener-trigger]]

Use the `<websocket:outbound-listener>` trigger to invoke an app flow when a message is received on a client's outbound endpoint. You can use the associated flow to perform tasks such as sending a return message to the server or processing the information sent by the server.

The flow associated with the Outbound Listener Trigger is invoked after the outbound WebSocket receives a message. Because a WebSocket is full-duplex, the Outbound Listener doesn't automatically send a response. Depending on your use case, you might want to process the messages without sending a response, or only send responses in certain cases.

To send a response, use the <<websocket/websocket-connector-operations.adoc#send-operation,WebSocket Send operation>>.

=== Example

*Reviewers: We need a better example than what's in the tech reference. It would be good to show a flow that sends a message.*

=== Output

The Outbound Listener trigger returns:

* A message payload that contains the outbound message content.
* An object of type `WebSocketAttributes` that contains message attributes.

The message MIME type is obtained from the Content-Type header of the HTTP request. If the Content-Type header isn't set, the MIME type defaults to one of these values, depending on the protocol’s DATA frame type:

* For a binary DATA frame, the MIME type is application/octect-stream.
* For a text DATA frame, the MIME type is text/plain.
