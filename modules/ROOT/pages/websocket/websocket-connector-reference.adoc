WebSocket Version 1.0.0

Anypoint Connector for WebSocket (WebSocket Connector) provides communication through the WebSockets protocol. This connector allows for external systems to open connections to the server (INBOUND sockets), or allows connections to external systems (OUTBOUND socket). In both cases, full duplex traffic is supported.

== Configurations
---
[[Config]]
=== Default Configuration

Configure the name and connection types for the default configuration.  

==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<Config_Connection, Connection>>
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Name a| String |  The identifier of this element used to reference it in other components |  | x
|===

==== Connection Types
[[Config_Connection]]
===== Connection

Configure the server, client, and reconnection parameters for the connection. 

====== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Server Settings a| <<WebSocketServerSettings>> |  |  | 
| Client Settings a| <<WebSocketClientSettings>> |  |  | 
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to `true`, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  | 
|===

== Operations

WebSocket Connector supports the following operations:

* <<Broadcast>> 
* <<BulkCloseSockets>> 
* <<CloseSocket>> 
* <<OpenOutboundSocket>> 
* <<Send>>

==== Associated Sources
* <<InboundListener>> 
* <<OnInboundConnection>> 
* <<OnSocketClosed>> 
* <<OutboundListener>> 


[[Broadcast]]
== Broadcast
`<websocket:broadcast>`

Sends the given content to all the active WebSockets that match the path, socketType and groups criteria. In the case of the path, the configured base path will not be considered, as you can target both inbound and outbound sockets. 

The message will be sent to all the matching sockets, even though it's possible that delivery to some of them fail. The operation will return a list of BroadcastFailure containing details of each of the failures. If none fail, an empty list is returned.
