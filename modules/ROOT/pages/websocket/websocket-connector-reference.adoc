Support Version: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

WebSocket Version 1.0.0

Anypoint Connector for WebSocket (WebSocket Connector) allows communication through the WebSockets protocol. This connector allows for external systems to open connections to this server (INBOUND sockets) or for it to connect to external systems (OUTBOUND socket). In both cases, full duplex traffic is supported.

[[Broadcast]]
== Broadcast
`<websocket:broadcast>`

Sends the given content to all the active WebSockets that match the path, socketType and groups criteria.

The message will be send to all the matching sockets, even though it's possible that delivery to some of them fail. The operation will return a list of BroadcastFailure containing details of each of the failures. If none fail, an empty list is returned
