The following concepts are integral to understanding how WebSocket Connector works:

* <<websocket-types,WebSocket types>>
* <<websocket-id,WebSocket ID>>
* <<groups,Groups>>

== Full-Duplex Communication Advantages [[full-duplex]]

In traditional HTTP, a connection is half-duplex (unidirectional) and works by using a request-response message exchange pattern:

. A client connects to a server and sends a request.
. The server processes the request and sends a response back.
. The client receives the request and the connection ends.

Traditional HTTP connections require a lot of overhead because the client operation is blocked until it receives a response from the server. Another disadvantage of using traditional HTTP connections is that the client must always initiate the request. Therefore, the server cannot push notifications to multiple applications at the same time.

When a client connects to a server using WebSockets, a persistent connection is established and kept open. Both the client and server can then send multiple messages to each other without needing to follow the HTTP request-response message exchange pattern. A WebsSocket is built on top of the existing HTTP infrastructure, making it easy to reuse infrastructure that is already in place for traditional HTTP.

For more information about WebSockets, see the IETF document for RFC 6455 - The WebSocket Protocol.

== WebSocket Types [[websocket-types]]

There are two types of WebSockets:

* inbound: WebSockets created when the Mule app listens for incoming connections.
+
In this scenario, an external system connects to an endpoint exposed by the app.
+
* Outbound: WebSockets created when the Mule app connects to an external system.
+
In this scenario, the app initiates communication and asks an external system to establish a WebSocket.

Once the initial connection is established, both types of WebSockets support bidirectional, full-duplex communication.

== WebSocket ID [[websocket-id]]

All WebSockets have a unique socket ID that identifies them. The app must reference these IDs to operate on individual WebSockets.

== Groups [[groups]]

WebSocket Connector introduces the concept of groups, which are string identifiers to which individual WebSockets can subscribe. An app can broadcast a single message to one or more groups of WebSockets. Groups facilitate the process of identifying which WebSockets should participate in each broadcast.

Subscriptions only exist in the context of a WebSocket Connector configuration instance. Therefore, when you establish a web socket between a Mule app and a remote system, subscribing the WebSocket on Mule's end of the connection to a group doesn't affect the WebSockets on the remote system's end.
