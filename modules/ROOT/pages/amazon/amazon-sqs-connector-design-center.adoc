Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information about Amazon SQS fields, see the xref:amazon/amazon-sqs-connector-reference.adoc[Amazon SQS Connector Reference].

== Configure the Input Source Trigger

To configure a trigger:

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Specify a value for *Project name*, and click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*.
. Click on the Trigger card.
. Configure the trigger.
+
You can use the following items as a trigger for your app:
+
  * The connector's *Receive messages* operation to initiate access to your app to receive messages from a specified queue.
  * *HTTP Connector* to initiate access to your app when the HTTP Listener accepts a request from a browser or application, such as Postman or CURL.
  * *Scheduler* to initiate access to your app at a specific time.

If you use an Amazon SQS connector's operation as a trigger, enter the URL of the Amazon SQS queue you want to receive messages from and the number of messages to receive on the *General* tab.

== Configure the Target Component

. Click *+* next to the trigger card.
. In *Select a component*, search for and select the connector name.
. Select an operation for the connector.
. Enter the required values in the *General* tab.
. If needed, enter values for other tabs.
. Specify access information to the connector resource, as described below.
