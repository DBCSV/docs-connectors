== Apply Policies

== Redelivery Policy

A redelivery policy is a filter that helps you conserve resources by limiting the number of times the Mule runtime engine (Mule) executes messages that generate errors. You can add a redelivery policy to any source in a flow.

When you add a redelivery policy to a flow’s source, Mule evaluates the received data before it executes the flow’s components. If a message delivery fails a specified number of times, the redelivery policy prevents the flow from processing the received data and raises a `REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED` error.
