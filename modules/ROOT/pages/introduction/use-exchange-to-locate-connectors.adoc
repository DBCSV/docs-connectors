Use Anypoint Exchange (Exchange) to discover connectors, templates, and examples, and to incorporate them into your app. Exchange serves as a repository for connectors, templates, and examples provided both by MuleSoft and by other organizations. Searches in Exchange apply only to the Exchange organization you are viewing.

Search in the https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Public Exchange] to access MuleSoft's public assets. If you search in a private organization's Exchange, you need access rights to that organization.

For more information about searching in Exchange, see xref:release-notes::connector/to-find-info[Find Asset Information].

== Discover and Add Connectors to Flow Designer and Studio Projects

You can discover connectors by starting the search in Exchange or by accessing Exchange from within an Anypoint Flow Designer or Anypoint Studio project:

* Start in Exchange to view a list of all MuleSoft-provided connectors or a subset of these connectors. From there, you can view a connector in Flow Designer or download it to Studio.
* Access Exchange from within a Flow Designer or Studio project to locate a template applicable to your use case.
