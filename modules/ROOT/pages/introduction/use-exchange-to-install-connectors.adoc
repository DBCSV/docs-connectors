Use Anypoint Exchange to discover connectors, connector templates, and app examples, and to incorporate them into your app. To access Exchange, use this URL: `https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/`.

Exchange serves as a repository for connectors, templates, and examples provided both by MuleSoft and by other organizations. Searches in Exchange apply only to the Exchange organization you are viewing. If you search in a private Exchange organization, the search lists that organization’s assets and not MuleSoft’s public assets.

To search in a private Exchange organization, you need access rights to that organization.

For more information about searching in Exchange, see xref:release-notes::connector/to-find-info[Find Asset Information].
