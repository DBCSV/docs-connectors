+++
The main class of an extension, is the entry point from which configurations, connection providers, operations and sources are going to be declared.
+++


== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Config


==== Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<config_basic-authentication, Basic Authentication>>
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Connection timeout a| Number |  +++Connection timeout for the request+++ |  +++30+++ | 
| Connection Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  +++Time unit to use in the Timeout configurations+++ |  +++SECONDS+++ | 
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  +++Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges the instances when it sees fit.+++ |  | 
|===

==== Connection Types
[[config_basic-authentication]]
===== Basic Authentication

+++
Basic Authentication is the simplest way of enforcing access controls because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages. Instead, it uses standard fields in the HTTP header, removing the need for handshakes. This mechanism provides no confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials. They are merely encoded with Base64 in transit, but not encrypted or hashed in any way.
+++

====== Parameters

| Service base URL a| String |  +++The base URL of the service on SAP S/4HANA to be accessed from the connector.+++ |  | x

| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  +++When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy+++ |  |
