Anypoint Design Center's Flow Designer enables you to create apps 
visually. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Flow Designer:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on Flow Designer field values, see 
the xref:sap-s4hana-soap/sap-s4hana-soap-connector-reference.adoc[SAP S/4HANA for SOAP Reference]. 

// Ensure that the connector reference xref and title are correct.

. Click *Create new application* to open Flow Designer.
. Specify a value for *Project name*, and click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*. 
. Click the trigger card.
. If you are using your connector as an input source trigger, search for the connector;
