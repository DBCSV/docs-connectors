Anypoint Design Center's Flow Designer enables you to create apps 
visually. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Flow Designer:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on Flow Designer field values, see 
the xref:sap-s4hana-soap/sap-s4hana-soap-connector-reference.adoc[SAP S/4HANA Cloud SOAP Connector Reference]. 

// Ensure that the connector reference xref and title are correct.

== Configure the Input Source Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application* to open Flow Designer.
. Specify a value for *Project name*, and click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*. 
. Click the trigger card.
. If you are using your connector as an input source trigger, search for the connector; 
otherwise, you can use HTTP or Scheduler.
. Complete these fields: 
// If <connector> has one or more source operations, list the 
// important and required fields and their values in a table.
+
[%header,cols=30s,55a,15a]

|Field |Description |Required?

. Click the *Test* button to test the connection.

Flow Designer automatically saves all changes.

== Configure the Target Component

. Click *+* next to the trigger card.

. Select the connector name. 
. Select an operation for the connector.
. Complete these fields:
+
// List the important and required fields and their values in a table.
// Because each operation has different fields, list the fields 
// that are common to each operation and describe them.

|Field |Description |Required?
