NetSuite Connector Version 9.1

The Anypoint Connector for NetSuite makes use of the SuiteTalk WSDL to provide SOAP-based integration and generate NetSuite business objects, makes use of different authentication levels, and supports error handling. This connector also provides access using REST calls to RESTlets that expose APIs created with SuiteScript.

== About Connectors

Anypoint connectors are Mule runtime engine extensions that enable you to connect 
to APIs and resources on external systems, such as Salesforce, NetSuite, ServiceNow,
and Twitter.

== Prerequisites

Before creating an app, you must have access to the NetSuite target resource and 
Anypoint Platform. You also need understand how to create a Mule app using 
Design Center or Anypoint Studio.
