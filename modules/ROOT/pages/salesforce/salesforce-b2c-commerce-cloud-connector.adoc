== About Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud Connector

Anypoint Connector for Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud Connector - Shop API is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation for the connector to perform. 

Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud Connector enables your user to access the Open Commerce API (OCAPI) by using certain configurations, and to then access the data, update the data, and delete the data, as required.

OCAPI enables you to access resources using HTTP requests and HTTP responses. Each resource is addressed by its unique URL, which includes the API version. Data is transported using request or header parameters, or within the request body as a JSON document with a defined structure. 

OCAPI is divided into different APIs: 

* Shop API enables a client to interact with the system as a shop customer or as an agent shopping on behalf of a customer.
* Data API gives create, read, update, and delete access to system resources.
* Meta API retrieves a formal description of the Open Commerce API, including custom attributes.
