== About WebSockets Group Management

As explained in the Get Started page, the WebSockets connector introduces the concept of Socket Groups.

 Groups are String identifiers that all Websockets can be optionally subscribed to. This is useful for what we call `Message segregation`, which is the ability to broadcast one single message to a group of different WebSockets. 

Examples of how to leverage groups can be found in the documentation of the broadcast operation. 

Both the `<websocket:inbound-listener>` trigger and the `<websocket:open-outbound-socket>` operation allow to specify default groups. That is groups that every new inbound and outbound sockets will be automatically subscribed to.

However, there are use cases which require to manually subscribe/unsuscrbie a given socket from a particular group.

For example, imagine the use case of a multitenant applicaiton in which an Inbound WebSocket is established. The initiator Http request includes an authentication header called `clientId`. We call a flow called `fetch-client-details` which validates say client id and sets a variable called `orgId` which identifies the organization the client belongs to. We then want the socket to be added to a group that identifies said organization.

As you can see, this group subscription is dynamic, since the group to be subscribed (the organization id) can only be determined at runtime.

Let's see how this flow would look like:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="onIncomingMessageFlow">
    <websocket:inbound-listener ​path​=​"/feed"​ ​config-ref​=​"ws"​ />
    
    <!-- Store relevant information in variables -->
    <set-variable variableName="socketId" value="#[attributes.socketId]" />
    <set-variable variableName="authHeader" value="#[attributes.headers.clientId]" />

    <!-- validate the auth Header -->
    <flow-ref name="fetch-client-details" />
    
    <!-- perform group subscription -->
    <websocket:subscribe-groups socketId="#[vars.socketId]" groups="#[[vars.orgId]]" config-ref="ws" />
</flow>
----

The flip side of this use case is that in which you also need to dynamic unsubscribe from a group. This can be achieved with the `<websocket:unsubscribe-groups>` operation:

[source,xml,linenums]
----

<websocket:unsubscribe-groups socketId="#[vars.socketId]" groups="#[[vars.orgId]]" config-ref="ws" />
