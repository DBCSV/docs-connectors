== WebSocket Attributes Object

The output attributes will contain every attribute expected in the HttpRequestAttributes(headers, queryParams, scheme, etc.) plus:

    * Socket id: used to identify the WebSocket. Use it to send a message back or close the socket. To access this value use: #[attributes.socketId].
    * Socket type: used to identify if the WebSocket is acting as 'INBOUND' (connection initiated externally) or 'OUTBOUND'(initiated connection to external service). To access this value use: #[attributes.socketType].
    * Group list the socket is currently subscribed to: the socket groups to which the receiving socket is subscribed. To access this value use #[attributes.groups], which will return a list with all the groups.

Other values you can access:

    * HTTP Protocol Version
    * Path
    * Local Address
    * Remote Address
    * Request URI
    * Base Path
    * Query Parameters
    * Query String
    * Headers
    * Scheme
