[[storedProcedure]]
=== Stored Procedure

== Sources

[[listener]]
=== On Table Row

`<db:listener>`

Selects from a table at a regular interval and generates one message per each obtained row.  Optionally, watermark and ID columns can be provided. 

If a watermark column is provided, the values taken from that column are used to filter the contents of the next poll, so that only rows with a greater watermark value are returned. If an ID column is provided, this component automatically makes sure that the same row is not picked twice by concurrent polls.
